## What I learned(Pro's)

- I learned `getComputedStyle()` methos and how it returns an object containing the values of all CSS properties of an element, after applying active stylesheets and resolving any basic computation those values may contain.
- In above project I used `getComputedStyle()` to get current styling properties of `border-radius` which I was able to target through `getPropertyValue()` method

## What I should've also done (Con's)

- Maybe I should have used functions to change border styling instead hard coading values.
- Also i should have added ability to copy the border radius property on click.
- But at last its a fun project completed in very less time 😅
